# 👋 Hi, I'm Zoe!  

I'm a **PhD student in Computer Science** at [MIT](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) and a **National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellow**. 

🔬 I work with [Ashia Wilson](https://www.ashiawilson.com/) and [Arvind Satyanarayan](https://vis.csail.mit.edu/) in the **Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)**, focusing on **Human AI-alignment in Generative AI models**. 

🏙️ Previously, I completed my Master's in **Building Technology** and **EECS** at MIT, advised by Christoph Reinhart in the [Sustainable Design Lab](https://web.mit.edu/sustainabledesignlab/), where I worked on **decision-making tools for building decarbonization**: help cities optimally meet **emission reduction targets** whilst considering equity .  

🏗️ Before that, I earned my **B.Arch. from Cornell University**, advised by [Jenny Sabin](https://www.jennysabin.com/) and [Timur Dogan](https://aap.cornell.edu/people/timur-dogan) in the [Environmental Systems Lab](https://es.aap.cornell.edu/), where I co-developed [Eddy3D](https://www.eddy3d.com/). My undergraduate thesis focused on **surrogate machine learning models for airflow simulations in buildings**.  

💼 I’ve previously worked as a **quant at [Point72](https://point72.com/)**, working in a macro pod focused on futures and derivatives, as well as an **intern at [SmartFab](https://www.smartfab.ai/)**, working on AI & analytics for industrial manufacturing.
