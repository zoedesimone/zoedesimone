👋 Hi there, I’m @zoedesimone, but I also go by Zoe.

👀 I’m primarily interested in ML, design & sustainability, but often stray into software development and comuptational design.

🌱 I’m a dual EECS & Building Technology MS student @ MIT.

🔭 I’m currently working prof. Ashia Wilson and Arvind Satyanarayan in CSAIL on Human AI-alignment in Generative AI models. 

🔭 and with prof. Christoph Reinhart in the Sustainable Design Lab (SDL) on decision making tools for building decarbonization. 

👩‍💻 Previously studied at Cornell University and co-developed [Eddy3D](https://www.eddy3d.com/).   

💬 Ask me about ML, computational design, & architecture.
